:summary: Finally I've moved my blog to Pellican-GitHub setup

I was thinking of moving my blog from resource hungry PHP-Wordpress to a more simple html/css based setup for long time. I've tried many things like Octopress and decided to stick with Pellican. Mainly because I am confirtable with Python than other languages like Ruby. I've tested other things in Python like Django and decided to go with Pellican because it is simple and easy to setup. 

So here I am running Pellican based blog on github. I am geting free top class hosting too :).
